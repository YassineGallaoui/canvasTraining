# Canvas Training
This repo is created to work and train on canvas topics in pure html/css and, more important, javascript.  

All pages are made following Georgi Nikoloff's course: https://www.awwwards.com/academy/course/dynamically-scripted-animations-with-javascript.  
In addition to this i further experimented some functionalities changing and playing not only with the code but also with formulas and trigonometry concepts.
